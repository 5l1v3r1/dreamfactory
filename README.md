DreamFactory 2.0 Application.

## Quick Setup

> **Note:** This quick setup instruction assumes that you are familiar with composer and the basics of how to setup a web and database server.

1. Clone this repository.
2. Copy .env-dist file to .env file and make necessary changes their including specifying DB connection info. By default it is setup to use MySql database. If you would like to use a different database please see config/database.php file.
3. Make sure that the 'storage' directry has proper permission so that your web server can write to it. 
4. Run composer update.
5. And that's it! Launch a web browser and point to your web server. It should prompt you with creating an admin user. 
6. Once you create the first admin user you can login with that user and start using dreamfactory!
